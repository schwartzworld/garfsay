# Garfsay

This is a toy project to learn Rust. It is a clone of cowsay but uses a fat cat instead of a cow. Happy Lasagna!

## Installation

At present the primary method of installation is to use `cargo`. Make sure you have `cargo` and `rust` installed and run the following command:

`cargo install garfsay`

Eventually I will make binaries available at [schwartz.world](https://schwartz.world/garfsay), but [that day is not today](#Contributions).

## Usage

`Garfsay` can be called two ways.

### Command line arguments

`$ garfsay Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me`

### Piping from stdout

`echo I aint the sharpest tool in the shed | garfsay`

## Contributions

This is very much a learning project, so please feel free to contribute in any way possible. Code contributions are welcome, as are bug reports, feature requests and help packaging the app for whatever package manager you think it should be in.
